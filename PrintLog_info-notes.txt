
MasterSi used as the PrintLogger
================================
- Software in controller v809 or later **
- Fit PrintLog_MSi01.bit firmware to a MasterSi
- Boot and check for 8 beeps
- SSH in to controller (pi/2020ale2020) and edit boot file to stop jet.ax running:
  $ . end.sh
	$ nano /Codex/mp-boot2.sh
	- Near the end of the script find "/Codex/*/Program/$JETA"
	- Put "echo " in front of it (bash doesn't like empty if-fi statements)
** Note if you do a CodeLoad it may re-program the FPGA. Check for the 8 beeps after!!


Master controller under test
============================
- Any Master with f/w or RJ45 head connectors (RJ45 double-speed mode not supported yet)
- Note only one PSU needed as 12v goes via f/w cables between controllers
- Fit f/w cables from head #1 of test controller to head #1 of Print-Logger
  - Head #2 to head #2 etc. Max 4 heads.
  - Note cables will physically cross over


Data logging
============
- Power up one of the controllers then SSH in to the PrintLogger
- Jet.ax should not be running
- Command format:
		$ sudo hello.ax SLICES FW_MODE INTERLEAVE INVERTS DOT_LIMIT/SLICE SHIFT_DOTS0 COMPRESS NO_CONSOLE FLIP_BITMAP
- FW_MODE means capture encoded serial data from f/w connectors
  - The alarm led will light to confirm f/w mode (and relay will click)
- Example with f/w conns:
		1x 72mm heads with f/w conns: $ sudo /Codex/???/Program/hello.ax 1 1 0 0 512 0 0 0 0
		2x 72mm heads with f/w conns: $ sudo /Codex/???/Program/hello.ax 2 1 0 0 512 0 0 0 0
		1x 18mm head with f/w conns: $ sudo /Codex/???/Program/hello.ax 1 1 0 0 128 0 0 0 0
- Capture is automatic and looks for gaps in printing
  - Capture can also be paused by activating PEC#2
- Outputs to LCD and BMP files in home/pi


Other features
==============
- Not documented here, but to know it's possible...
1. The PrintLogger can also capture unencoded data (SCK + DATA + FIRE) by adding a custom interface board ***
  - Therefore can capture raw X128 and Seiko head signals
  - The custom board converts TTL to LVDS using resistors
2. Captured & decoded data can be output to TX(7:0) on the head connector board
  - Fit the Debug jmper on the PrintLogger motherboard
  - Note the controller under test will receive strange register data as a result and may complain
  *** Useful to debug the signals on the custom board
3. TTZ mode can be supported
